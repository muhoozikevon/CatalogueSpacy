# Codespaces Template for Python and PyTorch NLP Development

This repository is a **template** for setting up a development environment in **GitHub Codespaces** specifically tailored for **Python** and **PyTorch** NLP projects. The repository is pre-configured to include all necessary tools, extensions, and settings to streamline your workflow.

## Purpose of This Repository

The goal of this repository is to save time and effort when creating future Codespaces for Python-based NLP projects. Instead of manually installing VS Code extensions and setting up each project, this template automates the process through a `.devcontainer` setup. All you need to do is create new repositories using this template, and Codespaces will automatically be configured with the tools you need.

12. **Live Share** (by Microsoft)  
    Enables real-time collaboration for pair programming and code reviews directly within VS Code.

13. **ESLint** (by Dirk Baeumer)  
    Provides linting capabilities for mixed environments, especially helpful if working with Python and web technologies.

### Source Control and GitHub Integration:
14. **GitHub Pull Requests and Issues** (by GitHub)  
    Manage GitHub issues, review pull requests, and monitor projects directly from VS Code.

15. **Git History** (by Don Jayamanne)  
    View and interact with the Git history of a repository, including comparing commits and visualizing the commit graph.

### Data Manipulation and Debugging:
16. **Kite Autocomplete AI Code** (by Kite)  
    Provides advanced autocompletion for Python libraries, including NLP and machine learning packages like NumPy and PyTorch.

17. **Pandas Notebooks** (by Alessandro Silva)  
    Helps visualize and manipulate datasets, a core task in most NLP projects.

18. **Python Test Explorer for Visual Studio Code** (by Little Fox Team)  
    Manages and runs Python tests, especially useful when debugging and ensuring NLP models behave as expected.

## Dependencies Installed via `requirements.txt`

The `requirements.txt` file in this repository includes several critical Python libraries that are essential for NLP and machine learning development:

1. **Torch**  
   PyTorch is a deep learning framework providing tensor computation and GPU acceleration. It is widely used for building neural networks and machine learning models.

2. **Torchvision**  
   Provides utilities and datasets for computer vision tasks using PyTorch, such as loading common datasets, model architectures, and image transformations.

3. **Torchaudio**  
   Extends PyTorch with audio processing tools, allowing you to handle audio datasets and models for tasks like speech recognition or audio classification.

4. **NumPy**  
   A fundamental package for scientific computing in Python, used for array operations, linear algebra, and numerical computations, which are often leveraged in deep learning models.

5. **Pandas**  
   A powerful data analysis and manipulation library. It is commonly used for handling structured/tabular data, such as loading and processing datasets in CSV or Excel formats, which is crucial in data preprocessing for NLP tasks.

6. **Transformers**  
   A library from Hugging Face for natural language processing (NLP) tasks that provides pretrained transformer models like GPT, BERT, and T5. It simplifies loading, training, and fine-tuning state-of-the-art models for tasks like text classification, translation, and question answering.

These dependencies enable the development of PyTorch-based models, natural language processing pipelines, and other machine learning tasks.

## How to Use This Repository

1. **Creating a New Repository from This Template**:
   - When starting a new NLP project, click the **"Use this template"** button on this repository.
   - GitHub will create a copy of this repository for you to use in your new project.

2. **Setting Up GitHub Codespaces**:
   - Once you create a repository using this template, you can open it in **GitHub Codespaces**.
   - The environment will automatically install all the listed extensions and apply workspace settings through the `.devcontainer` setup.

3. **Customizing for Your Project**:
   - If your project requires specific Python dependencies, update the `requirements.txt` file in your new repository.
   - Add any additional VS Code extensions or settings as needed in the `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` file.

4. **Post-Creation Command**:
   - The template includes a `postCreateCommand` that automatically installs dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`. Make sure to keep this file updated.

## Important Settings

- **Black as the Default Formatter**: Black is set as the default Python code formatter for this repository, ensuring consistent formatting based on the Black style guide.
- **Pylint for Linting**: Pylint is used as the primary linter to enforce Python coding standards and catch potential issues.
- **Conda Disabled**: The discovery of Conda environments has been disabled in this setup. If you use Conda environments, you can re-enable this by adjusting the `python.condaPath` setting in the `devcontainer.json`.

## Future Reminders

The purpose of this template is to **automate** the setup process for future Codespaces environments when working on Python-based NLP projects. It reduces the manual effort of installing extensions and configuring the environment each time a new repository is created.

If you ever modify your extension or tooling preferences, remember to update the `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` file in this repository so that future projects are aligned with your latest preferences.
